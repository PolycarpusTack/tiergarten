- Implemented sync locking to prevent race conditions
- Fixed memory leaks in SSE endpoints
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff

### 4. **Database Schema Updates** ✅

- Added missing foreign key relationships

## Issues Encountered and Resolved

### 1. **Duplicate Declaration**
- **Issue**: JiraSyncOrchestrator was declared twice in server.js
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate declaration

### 2. **Syntax Error in Routes**
- **Issue**: Double `try` block in tickets-routes.js
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate try statement

### 3. **DuckDB Compatibility**
- **Issue**: Partial indexes not supported (`WHERE` clause in CREATE INDEX)
- **Fix**: Removed WHERE clause from index creation

### 4. **Database Lock Issue**
- **Issue**: DuckDB file locked by another process
- **Note**: This is normal in development; restart server to resolve
